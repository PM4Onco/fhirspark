# FhirSpark

FhirSpark is a tool that offers a reversible translation between the JSON sent via REST from [MTB-cBioPortal](https://github.com/PM4Onco/MTB-cbioportal) and FHIR resources. Using this method it is possible to store therapy recommendations and follow up data from Molecular Tumor Boards in an interoperable way.

It is reccommended to deploy and use FhirSaprk within the complete stack of [MTB-cBioPortal](https://github.com/PM4Onco/MTB-cbioportal).

## Get started

Most hospital information systems follow an order/entry based structure. Therefore (if present) the patient attribute `ORDER_ID` will be exported to FhirSpark and a FHIR `ServiceRequest` this will later on ensure that the therapy recommendation can be successfully linked with the originating order in the hospital information system.

To get started, copy the `settings.yaml.example` file to `settings.yaml`. This avoids future conflicts within the git tree. You need to tailor the configuration parameters to fit your environment first. The following configuration parameters are available:

| Parameter (yaml / Environment)                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
